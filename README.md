# Web-based-Chest-X-ray-Classification-for-Pneumonia-Detection-Using-CNN
This project is a Flask-based web application for detecting pneumonia from chest X-ray images using a fine-tuned ResNet50 model. Users can upload chest X-rays, and the system predicts whether the image indicates "Pneumonia" or "Normal." It combines deep learning with an intuitive web interface for medical imaging analysis.
